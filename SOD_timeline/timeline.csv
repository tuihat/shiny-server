bottom on the coring wireline. Pump pressure is then applied to the drill pipe, which severs shear pins and strokes the core barrel 9.5 m into the sediment. The inner core barrel, containing the core, is then retrieved
by wireline. After core retrieval, the bit and bottom-hole assembly (BHA) are advanced 9.5 m, and the process is repeated.
