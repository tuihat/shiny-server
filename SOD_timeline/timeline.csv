Introduced on July 1, 1963, the basic format consisted of five digits. In 1983, an extended ZIP+4 code was introduced; it included the five digits of the ZIP Code, followed by a hyphen and four digits that designated a more specific location. The term ZIP is an acronym for Zone Improvement Plan; it was chosen to suggest that the mail travels more efficiently and quickly (zipping along) when senders use the code in the postal address. The term ZIP Code was originally registered as a service mark by the USPS; its registration expired in 1997.",yes,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_Code

8,Confirmation of plate tectonics (Leg 3),1/15/1969 01:00,NA,science,red_style,"One of the most important discoveries was made during Leg 3. The crew drilled 17 holes at 10 different sites along a oceanic ridge between South America and Africa. The core samples retrieved provided definitive proof for continental drift and seafloor renewal at rift zones. This confirmation of Alfred Wegener's theory of continental drift strengthened the proposal of a single, ancient land mass, which is called Pangaea. The samples gave further evidence to support the plate tectonics theory, which at the time attempted to explain the formation of mountain ranges, earthquakes, and deep sea trenches.

A re-entry cone 16 feet in diameter and 14 feet tall was lowered on the drill string to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean in 10,000 feet of water 180 miles Southeast of New York. The drill string was pulled out of the cone and D/V Glomar Challenger was allowed to move slightly away from the site. Using sonar scanning equipment, the cone was successfully re-entered qnd the first sediment core - gray mud - recovered with the new capability was brought aboard early in the morning of June 15,1970. Operational re-entry was achieved on Christmas Day (December 25) 1970, during Leg 15 in the Caribbean Sea. Drilling in 13,000 feet of water in the Venezuelan Basin at Site 146, a dull bit was replaced and the drill string rammed back into the same bore hole.

The XCB is typically deployed when the formation becomes too stiff to piston core (i.e., upon piston coring refusal) or when it is not hard enough to permit efficient recovery with the Rotary Core Barrel (RCB). The XCB relies on rotation of the drill string to advance the hole, and the XCB cutting shoe trims the core sample at the same time.

17,First use of hydraulic piston corer,6/2/1979 01:00,NA,tech,orange_style,"The Advanced Piston Corer (APC) is crucial for high-resolution climate and paleoceanographic studies. The APC is a hydraulically actuated piston corer designed to recover relatively undisturbed samples from very soft to firm sediments. Such sediments cannot be recovered well by rotary coring. The APC core barrel is run to
bottom on the coring wireline. Pump pressure is then applied to the drill pipe, which severs shear pins and strokes the core barrel 9.5 m into the sediment. The inner core barrel, containing the core, is then retrieved
by wireline. After core retrieval, the bit and bottom-hole assembly (BHA) are advanced 9.5 m, and the process is repeated. The tool was first developed and used during Leg 64 of DSDP, and later developed into the modern APC system.",yes,https://iodp.merlinone.net/MX/ContentHub/Digital_Library/index.html?portalview=8613

CORK seals the top of the casing in an International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) reentry cone installation to prevent circulation between the open hole and ocean bottom water. CORKs are designed for long-term in situ monitoring of temperature and pressure as well as collecting borehole fluid samples through
added tubing and valves. The CORK also provides a means to hang a third-party sensor or an osmotic sampler (to collect geochemical samples) in the casing and open hole. Remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) or submersibles are routinely used to retrieve the data from the top of a CORK for shore-based study.
